        <h1 class="child">WHAT IS CSS?</h1>
        <p class="ch200">CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</p>
        <p class="ch2000"> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML. CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</p>

        <h2 class="child2">WHAT DO WE USE CSS FOR?</h2>
        <p class="ch201">CSS is used for defining the styles for web pages. It describes the look and formatting of a document which is written in a markup language. It provides an additional feature to HTML. It is generally used with HTML to change the style of web pages and user interfaces. The result of using CSS is usually like this: <img src="/OIP.jpg" height="347px" width="490px"></p>

        <h3 class="child3">HOW CSS CAME ABOUT</h3>
        <p class="ch202">When tags like *font*, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process. To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.</p>
        <p class="ch2022">CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page! Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is cornerstone web technology which enables beautiful web pages across a range of devices. CSS was first proposed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie while working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1994. Since then, CSS has added many features, and most of the information you read today will be presented by a CSS rendering engine.</p>
